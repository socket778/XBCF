# Accelerated Bayesian Causal Forests (XBCF)

## About
Accelerated Bayesian Causal Forests (XBCF) is a model for conditional average treatment effect estimation; the paper is available [here](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/krantsevich23a/krantsevich23a.pdf). The `StochasticTree` [repository](https://github.com/StochasticTree/stochtree-cpp) has become the new home for XBCF: it provides both R and Python implementations and is actively maintained. 

## Installation

Please visit https://github.com/StochasticTree/stochtree-cpp for the most recent version of XBCF, as this repository is no longer being maintaned.
